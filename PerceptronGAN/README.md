## Brief Synopsis:

GANs, also called Generative Adverserial Networks, is a type of unsupervised learning architecture that works on the principle of a minimax game between two models: a generator and a discriminator. The generator tries to fool the discriminator by making realistic images, while the discriminator tries to guess which images out of the dataset are fake. This process trains both of the models to become better at thier objective. 

This architecture was hard to implement because I have never worked with generational models. The code written by the paper authors is not supported anymore, so I had to rely on a video that implemented it.
